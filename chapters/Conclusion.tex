\section{Further Work}
There is no doubt this work can be improvend and develop further. 

\subsection*{Rearange loadcells on UAV}
The loadcells on the UAV can be rearranged to ensure the center of gravity and the cable connection coming closer to eachother, and thus improves the UAV's stability.

\subsection*{Messureing the horizontal angle on Ground Control Station}
The loadcells on Ground Control Station is designed with too large loadcells and thus the messurement precision can be improved with finding more sutiable loadcells.

\subsection*{Power system}
At the moment the powersupply system are only able to deliver 400W insted of 500W over only 20m of cable. The limiting factor is in the converters/inverters system developed by another student project. A way of solving this problem is to combine the powersupply from the cable with a on board battery. When the UAV not are using all the power it can recharge the battery and when extra power is neeed is can be delivered in combination with the battery.
