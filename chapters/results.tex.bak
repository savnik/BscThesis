\chapter{Test and Results}
This chapter deals with testing of the prototype, discussion of the results achieved and how to improve the results in case the data achieved is not satisfying.  

\section{Cable Drum}
To address the heating issue in the cable drum a test was performed to evaluate the heating’s influence, in order to incorporate the results in the design process.\\

\subsection{Test - Worst-case heating in cable}
The worst-case test with full load over long time was performed at indoor environment with room temperature on 24 degree Celsius. The coil was excited with 75V DC and 360W just over an hour. This is not 100 per cent of the UAVs power consumption, but the testing equipments upper limit. The inner diameter of the coil is 10cm and is made of 2mm thick PVC pipe.

\section{Summary}
Even through the cable is not excited with 100 per cent of the UAV power consumption; the test puts the heating issue in perspective. The heating is not critical high, but must be considered in the cable requirement specification; hence, CE certification only requires the cable to withstand up to 80 degrees\cite{Parliament2006}.

\section{Horizontal Measuring Device}
This measurement devices is tested with regards to stability and the results of the calculated position references. Hence this is relative cheap load cells, the precision is expected to be with in an acceptable region.

\subsection{Calibration}
First off is calibrating the load cells. First measurement is without any forces acting in $x$ and $y$ direction in order to determine the offset of each load cell.
The offset for $x$ is found to $-455.9787$ and the $y$ offset to $-511.2618$, as seen on figure \ref{fig:HMDcalib}.\\

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\caption[Raw data from load cell]{Raw input data from load cell $x$ and $y$. The average line is the calculated offset used for calibration. Measured without load in any directions.}
\label{fig:HMDcalib}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Next 1000g of load is put on the load cell with a rope through the Teflon ring first purely in positive $x$ direction and next in purely $y$ direction, in order to determine the gain factor $Kx$ and $Ky$. $Kx$ is found to $0.4786$ and $Ky$ to $-0.5134$. Afterwards the calibration is tested by applying $600$g of force in $x$-direction and then checking the result.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{graphics/gcs_test/calib_result_compare.eps}
\caption[Comparing raw data from load cells to the calibrated values]{Comparing raw data to the calibrated values. The $x$-calibrated values are between $633$g and $636$g, then the force applied was $600$g. The $33-36$g difference is most likely caused by the limitations of precision from the spring load. The y-calibrated data is ranging from $-29$g to $-32$g. It is expected the precision can vary $\pm75$g around the zero balance.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test of calibration}
After the calibration process, a test of the calibration shows the quality of the calibration.
This test is performed by applying a known force in a combination of $x$ and $y$ direction. For this test $\phi$ is set to 45 degrees and the total force is $1$kg. On figure \ref{fig:phi45deg1kg} it is seen that the data slightly decreases over time. This is probably due to tolerances in the manufacturing process of the mount enabling the load cell to move slightly over time or the elasticity of the connecting rope between the spring load and the load cell.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{graphics/gcs_test/phi45deg1kg.eps}
\caption[Test combines both $x$ and $y$ direction]{This test combines both $x$ and $y$ direction, therefore the force is calculated into the variable $r$, equivalent to $T_0$ from the analysis chapter. Notating at around $1$kg of load the data drift slightly decreasing.}
\label{fig:phi45deg1kg}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\noindent
On figure \ref{fig:phi45deg1kg} it is seen that the data slightly decreases overtime. This is probably due to tolerances in the manufacturing process enabling the load cell to move slightly over time or it can be caused by the spring load is permanently bending. Taking a closer look at the data on figure \ref{fig:phi45deg1kgdata} showing this phenomena applies to both $x$ and $y$ load cell. Because it applies to both load cells the calculated angle $\phi$ is constant, thus the drift the data is still valid and results in an accurate angle.

\label{fig:phi45deg1kgdata}
\end{figure}


\newpage
\subsection{Testing with $\theta>0$}
Next test is performed by keeping the $\phi$ angle and the tension constant and varying the $\theta$ angle. Is is expected as $\theta$ approach $90$ degrees the measured force will be approaching $0$. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{graphics/loadcell_test2.png}
\caption{Testing the horizontal measuring device by keeping $\phi$ constant and varying $\theta$.}
\label{fig:loadcell_test2}
\end{figure}

\noindent
At $\theta=45$ degrees and 1kg of load the measured result is very close to the expected result.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{graphics/gcs_test/45degTheta1kg.eps}
\caption[Comparing the measured load to the theoretical value]{Comparing the measured load to the theoretical value. Showing slightly less than expected.}
\label{fig:45degTheta1kg}
\end{figure}

\noindent
At all previous tests the load has only been anchored in the Teflon ring, but in the real setup the cable are anchored in the winch instead. This mean the measured force is now only a component of the total force. From figure \ref{fig:catenary_force_diagram} $T_0$ only has an x-component, but when the cable now is anchored in the winch the total force equation change to:
\todo{ref til sum af kræfter i 2.4 + lav diagram}
\begin{equation}
\sum T -\lambda gs + (T_{0,x} + T_{whinch,y} ) = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent
Hence the measurement device only measures $T_{0,x}$, $T_{whinch,y}$ is unknown. This test will show how much $T_{winch,y}$ influences.
On figure \ref{fig:45degTheta1kg} the measured values are slightly higher than expected. At $\theta = 0$ the overshoot is $13-17$g and at $\theta = 45$ the overshoot is $28-32$g, which is within what's in the first test was discussed as due to limitation in precision of the calibration.

\caption[Comparing measured results to the theoretically expected, $\theta$ variable]{Comparing measured results to the theoretically expected when varying $\theta$ and 1kg load. The results is a little higher than expected, but comparing to figure \ref{fig:45degTheta1kg} this result is unexpected.}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Summary}
The prototype is able to measure the force in $x$- and $y$-direction, $\phi$ and $r$ can be calculated with good results. Higher precision might be possible with more precise testing equipment.
The 5kg load cell has a zero balance at $\pm75g$. Any values close to this range must be considered as very unreliable. 
The force in $T_{winch,y}$ is quite small and can therefore be ignored.
