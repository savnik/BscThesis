\chapter{Summary}
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or UAVs is getting more commen in everyday life, both as hobby project and industrial applications. The aim of this projects is to propose a solution to extend flight time for UAV's in an industrial application using a tether cable connection. It is desired to develop a platform, that handles the mechanical part of winching and storing the cable, and the electrical part of using the cable as position reference for the UAV, and using the cable for communication with the UAV.
Using a hexacopter(a 6 rotor UAV) with lifting capabilities of about 3kg and a 50m light weight cable ensures the UAV to be able to lift the cable.
Two metodes of winching and storing the cable is analysed, and one selected for prototyping.
Two electrical measurement devices are developed to measure position referances for position control of UAV. This work does not deal with the position controller for the UAV.
A Ethernet link from the Ground Control Station to the UAV is established through a regular Ethernet over power line adapter.
Both Ground Control Station and the UAV are designed to run on Beaglebone Black, the actual flight controller is a PixHawk.
The system design and prototype is analysed and discussed for further development on this project.
