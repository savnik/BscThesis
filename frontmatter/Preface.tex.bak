\noindent
This project is an innovation project, which pushes the boundaries of the relative low cost technology. There is an Old Danish saying that "Deep fall, high flying". Innovation project is about being willing to take a high risk, of falling deep, to achieve results no one thought was possible. If every innovation project succeeded, it is not innovation - but only a further development of existing technology. To achieve an innovative goal, you have to set a goal 110 per cent higher of what you expect to achieve and afterwards be fair in sentencing if missing the target.\\
