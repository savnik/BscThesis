\chapter{Acknowledgements}
A special thanks to my two academic advisers, for always seeing the possibilities rather than the impossibilities in this project. Thanks to SÃ¸ren Hansen for introducing me to ''a real world problem'' that is very relevant today. Thanks to Christian Andersen for always having time to help me problem solving or introduce me to programming concepts, even when it got late in the evening. It has been supportive to see and feel you both share a huge personal interest in this project.\\

Thanks to all friends and family who has supported me though this project and helped me having time for this project to become a success. A special thanks to Nicholas Swiatecki who helped me making this thesis readable and detect misspellings.\\

Thanks to Martin Meister from DTU Skylab team for helping out with the mechanical work and supplying materials for this project. Whenever the mechanic from the institute only saw problems, Martin Meister always saw possibilities and guided me towards a mechanical solution. It has been a long battle for me, without any mechanical experience, to master such an underestimated expertise, both the design process, manufacturing parts and documentation. \\

Thanks to RS Components for sponsoring electrical and mechanical components for this project.
