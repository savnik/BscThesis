\chapter{Acknowledgements}
A special thanks to my to academic advisers, for always seeing the possibilities rather than the impossibilities in this project. Thanks to SÃ¸ren Hansen for introducing me to ''a real world problem'' that is very relevant today. Thanks to Christian Andersen for always having time to help me problem solving or introduce me to programming concepts, even then it got late in the evening. It has been very supportive to see that you both share a huge personal interest in this project.\\

Thanks to all friends and family who has supported me though this project and helped me having time for this project to become a success. \\

Thanks to Martin Meister from DTU Skylab team for helping out with the mechanical work and supplying materials for this project. Then mechanic from the institute only saw problems Martin always saw possibilities and guided me towards a solutions. It has been a long battle for me, without any mechanical experience, to master such a underestimated expertise, both the manufacturing part and documentation. \\
