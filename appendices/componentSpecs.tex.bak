\section{ÖLFLEX HEAT 180 Deg H05SS-F 2 x 0.75mm}
RS part number: 807-9259\\
RS Description:\\
Europe-wide standardised silicone connection cables with increased mechanical performance
Halogen-free and flame-retardant (IEC 60332-1-2)
Good hydrolysis and UV-resistance
Resistant to a multitude of oils, alcohols, vegetable and animal fats and chemical substances
EWKF: Initial tear propagation and notch resistance
More durable than conventional H05SS-F standardised cables
Flexibility simplifies installation where space is limited
Possesses insulatin Polytetrafluoroethylene cables for most extreme loads
Space-saving installation due to small cable diameters
Ideal for harsh environments
Stress crack resistant to frequent ambient temperature fluctuations
Resistant to contact with mostly all highly aggressive chemical media
Low outgassing behaviour
Temperature and UV resistant
For use in areas with high ambient temperatures and occasionally mechanical stress
Typical fields of application include steel, ceramic and iron works; bakery equipment and industrial furnaces; electric motor industry; sauna/solarium construction; thermal and heating elements; lighting technology; ventilator engineering; air-conditioning technology; galvanisation technology.
